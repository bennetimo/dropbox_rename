Uploading photos/videos straight from phone to Dropbox renames all the files. How annoying!
This is a *very* simple (hacked together) script to rename images and videos from the dropbox naming convention back to how they're stored on the Galaxy Nexus/Nexus 5 etc.

2013-09-13 21.41.35.jpg becomes IMG_20130913_214135.jpg
2013-09-13 16.00.14.mp4 becomes VID_20130913_160014.mp4

Panorama's are renamed back as IMG_ not PANO_ as would be on the device.

Usage

Save script into directory with photos. Run:

	./dropbox_rename.sh
